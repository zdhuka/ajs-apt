Preface
All programmers want their code to work the way they intended. Jasmine, a popular
testing framework for the JavaScript programming language, allows you to achieve that
goal. Through coded specifications, Jasmine helps make your JavaScript work exactly
how it’s supposed to. In this book, we’ll explore Jasmine in detail, from its basic concepts
to its advanced features.
This book aims to explain the concepts of testing and test-driven development, as well
as why they’re useful. It then aims to dive into Jasmine and explain how it can help
programmers test their JavaScript code. By the end of this book, I aim to give readers
an understanding of Jasmine’s concepts and syntax.
Who Should Read This Book
This book is intended for programmers who are familiar with some more advanced
JavaScript features, such as closures and callbacks, and who have a general understanding
of JavaScript’s prototype system. If you are interested in learning how to write reliable
JavaScript code, this is the book for you.
Jasmine is useful when building a maintainable and scalable JavaScript application, either
in a browser or on a server. It can help ensure that a browser’s client-side data
models are performing properly, or that a server is correctly serving pages.
Jasmine is also useful for building reliable JavaScript libraries. It can help ensure that
the exposed API of your library matches what you intend it to match.
