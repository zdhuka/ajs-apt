Using Code Examples
This book is here to help you get your job done. In general, if this book includes code
examples, you may use the code in this book in your programs and documentation. You
do not need to contact us for permission unless you’re reproducing a significant portion
of the code. For example, writing a program that uses several chunks of code from this
book does not require permission. Selling or distributing a CD-ROM of examples from
O’Reilly books does require permission. Answering a question by citing this book and
quoting example code does not require permission. Incorporating a significant amount
of example code from this book into your product’s documentation does require
permission.
We appreciate, but do not require, attribution. An attribution usually includes the title,
author, publisher, and ISBN. For example: “JavaScript Testing with Jasmine by Evan
Hahn (O’Reilly). Copyright 2013 Evan Hahn, 978-1-4493-5637-8.”
