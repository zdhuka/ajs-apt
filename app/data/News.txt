APTARA

At any given time seven days a week, 24 hours a day, an employee at a Hilton hotel is troubleshooting a customer problem and helping a guest enjoy a better stay at one of the company’s more than 4,000 hotels in 18 countries. When the business is 24/7, learning should be too, and Hilton Worldwide’s learning and development department set out to create a social learning platform to make it so.

Hilton partnered with Aptara to launch a Web-based learning portal called the President’s Portal that connects hotel general managers across the globe and allows them to share practices in real time at the pace of business. Since its launch in 2011, more than 450 managers have created and updated personal profiles, accessed blogs from senior leaders and participated in discussion forums.$
